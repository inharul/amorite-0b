# `Amorite 0B`

This repository stores the prototype of project `amorite` which is focused towards being a fully customizable, open-source, and free creative writing software. **Amorite** gives you the tools to tailor your writing environment to your needs, so you can stop finding the "perfect" writing experience and instead create your own one.

`3/12` `0.1` `A stable electron app`

> We are building the features, so you can create your own place for writing with it.

<!-- Preview -->

**As of now, we are trying to create a working demo for our beta testers and collecting feedback only.**

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. Even fully working **features may be deprecated** or rebuilt from the ground up **based on feedback and our evolving philosophy**.
> 2. **Any current technology, framework, or tooling** we are using **does not dictate** what we might use in **the future**.

## ❤️For Testers

If you are a tester or have been directed here by the developer or a fellow tester, please read the following:

1. The **latest version of the app will always be available as the [latest release](https://github.com/inharul/amorite-0b/releases) on the right-hand side**.
2. To download, click on "Assets" and find the installer or executable for your operating system. **[Web users can ignore this.]**
3. You’re encouraged to explore new features and share your feedback _(which I genuinely appreciate and love to hear)_—via the Discord community, the friend who introduced you to the project, or directly with me (the best way amongst all).

## Source Code

This project (currently) uses [electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/) for distribution, [react](https://react.dev) for the frontend and _webpack_ for bundling.

> [!WARNING]  
> This prototype is intended for a limited group of testers, and certain parts of the code may have security vulnerabilities as we refine the application and explore its limits. **It is strongly advised not to use this software for daily or production use at this stage for others.**

If you know what you are doing then running it on your machine is straightforward:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inharul/amorite-0b.git
cd amorite-0b
npm install # Make sure you have Node.js and a package manager installed
npm start # Starts the development server
```

It is not built on top of any boilerplate. _Yes, that's why it's not structured that well right now._ You can check the first two commits to see how it was set up.
